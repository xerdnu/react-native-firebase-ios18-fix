# ðŸ‘¾ Temporary Fix
Fix for preventing duplicate FCM notifications on iOS 18 in `react-native-firebase` by tracking and limiting processed messages.

## Description
This fix addresses the issue with `duplicate` Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) notifications on iOS 18 in react-native-firebase. The problem arises because of `onMessage` being triggered multiple times on iOS 18 devices. 

To prevent this, the fix stores processed messageIds in an array and checks if a message has already been processed. If a message has already been handled, it is ignored. Additionally, the array is kept trimmed to the last 10 processed messages, ensuring memory efficiency while preventing duplicate notifications.

## Usage
Here's a simple example:
```jsx
import { tempIOS18Fix } from './tempIOS18Fix';

useEffect(() => {
  const processedMessagesFix = [];
  const unsubscribe = messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
      if (!tempIOS18Fix(remoteMessage, processedMessagesFix)){
          return;
      }
  });

  return unsubscribe;
}, []);  
```
